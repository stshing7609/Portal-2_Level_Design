Set Up:

1. Own Portal 2 On Steam. 
2. Install both Portal 2 and the Portal 2 Authoring Tools.
3. Move .vmf files to: ..\Steam\SteamApps\common\Portal 2\sdk_content\maps
4. Open the Authoring Tools.
5. Load the .vmf files in Authoring Tools
6. Run the map(F9).
7. It should compile and load the map in Portal 2(should open automatically).

Changes:

Iterated map #3. Made minor improvements to map #1 & #2.
After looking into hooking up the maps, it was decided that the steps we would need to take are best saved til the end as if we want to make adjustments to the levels, it would require re-hooking the maps.

Current State:

Right now all the levels are individual and are not hooked up.

Map Order:

Highway to Hell
Stairway to Heaven
Devil Went Down To Georgia

To Do:

-Hook up Maps.
-Test and Iterate Changes
